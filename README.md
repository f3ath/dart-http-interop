# http_interop
A thin package to allow interoperability between different HTTP client and server implementations in Dart.

There are many cases where you want to use a simple HTTP message exchange between a client and a server. 
This package provides a set of interfaces and models to allow
independence from the underlying client and server implementations.
This means less boilerplate code and easier testing.
